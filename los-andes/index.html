The Andean melodies most people are exposed to today, however, are a result of centuries of colonialism and the migrations of peoples from different regions and continents. Let’s take a look at how all this happened.</p><p>Many people associate indigenous Andean instruments to the time of the Inca. Flutes are generically labeled “Inca Pan-Pipes” and the images of Macchu Picchu are conjured up in the imagination. While the Incas certainly employed the instruments we know as “Andean”, it is important to understand that many cultures preceded the Inca dynasty, and with those cultures flourished music and instrumentation that the Incas merely inherited. Tawantinsuyu, the Inca Empire, lasted a mere two hundred and fifty years before its demise at the hands of Spanish invaders. Originally from the Cuzco valley, the Incas expanded rapidly, imposed their language (Quechua) and exacted tribute from their subjects. In little more than two centuries, they stretched as far north as southern Colombia, and as far south as the Rio Maule in southern Chile. Invariably, they introduced styles of music and instruments during their conquests. But were getting ahead of ourselves. What about the Pre-Inca civilizations?</p><p>There are a number of major cultures that the Incas would have to give credit to. In the highlands of present day Bolivia exist the ruins of Tiawanaku, a culture that was predominantly of the Aymara people. In the coastal regions of Peru, we have the Nazca culture, their artwork often depicting the playing of sikus during religious ceremonies and funerals. Elsewhere were ceramic antaras found in gravesites and tombs. Other fabulous cultures included the Moche, the Huari, Chimú and Chavín. Through numerous excavations, archaeologists have proven that the kena was, in its most rudimentary form, a flute that preceded the birth of Christ.</p><p>In Pre-Colombian South America, music was a sacred art, a powerful source of communication with the divine world. Religious ceremonies paid homage to the pantheon of deities closely associated with the landscape and weather. The agricultural calendar, such an integral part of daily life, was marked with different celebrations and musical traditions. Prior to the arrival of Europeans there were no string instruments in the Americas. The Andes were dominated by the sound of wind and percussion. The tuning was pentatonic and the melodies were of another world. Many of these traditions survive today in the form of Tarkeadas (Tarka Flutes) Mohoceñadas (Mohoceño flutes) Sikuriadas (Siku flutes) and the dance of the Kena–Kena (Kena flutes). When people ask about “traditional” Andean music, this is what I think of. It is not soft, melodious or soothing. Rather, it is raucous and loud, bordering on discordant. It almost always includes the playing of large bass drums (italaques and wangaras), snare drums, and at least a dozen flute players employing pipes of different sizes and tunings. Perhaps the gods demand this?</p><article><picture>
