First, the introduction of string instruments and, second, the western musical scales: Major and minor keys, sharps and flats. The standard key for most Andean flutes is G major. Nevertheless, the combination of Andean woodwinds and Spanish strings is a fairly recent development. Typically, most people are exposed to the classic Andean sounds of the kena and siku, accompanied by guitar, charango and the bombo. This is emblematic of what musicologists refer to as the “Pan-Andean” movement. Traced back to the late nineteen fifties and nineteen sixties, this followed the migration of rural indigenous people to the large urban centers in search of work, with the introduction of Andean pipes into the urban setting and the inevitable mixture with “criollo” culture. The “criollo” culture refers to the mestizo, or mixed race culture, that is the product of European and indigenous ethnicities. Musically speaking, no instrument better exemplifies this than the charango. The charango is a string instrument that embodies the combination of these two cultures. It is descended from the vihuela de mano (hand-lute), brought by Spaniards from the Mediterranean. The instrument was copied by the indigenous population, and the end result was a new and unique addition to Andean folk music. Many people credit the town of Potosí, Bolivia, as the birth place of the charango. Peruvians, on the other hand, tend to disagree, arguing that the charango comes from Ayacucho, Peru.</p><p>The “Pan–Andean” sound that has come to symbolize Andean music for most westerners, can trace its lineage back to several monumental groups. In La Paz, Bolivia, a group called “Los Jairas” popularized the new music and was one of the first ensembles to introduce Europeans to the Andean sound. The group included the Bolivian master, Ernesto Cavour, on charango and a swiss flautist by the name of Gilbert Favre, on kena. During my travels in Bolivia I was told that it was “El Gringo”, Gilbert Favre, who showed Bolivians not to be ashamed to play the kena. Such was the colonial stigma that had continued up until that time.</p><picture>

<p>Meanwhile, in Chile there was an important movement going on called “La Nueva Canción Chilena” (New Chilean Song Movement). Young musicians, artists and students, were discovering Andean instruments and beginning to incorporate them into their music. Groups, such as Inti-illimani, traveled to Bolivia to learn about Andean folk music and bring the style and instruments back to Chile. Artists like Quilapayun, Victor Jara and Violeta Parra, used the new song movement as a social tool. The songs were infused with politically charged rhetoric. Highly critical of influence from the North (USA), Chilean musicians made Andean instruments and Andean music synonymous with the political left. The simple act of wearing a poncho became subversive. The culmination of this movement was the election of socialist president, Salvador Allende, in 1970.</p><p>Following the overthrow of Allende, in 1973, Andean music and instruments were forbidden in Chile. The music had become closely identified with the left, and the military government saw to its eradication. Many artists, like Victor Jara, were disappeared or murdered. The folk groups Inti-illimani and Quilapayun, were exiled. Inti-illimani took up residence in Italy and the popularity of Andean music in Europe continued to soar. At this time, due to the lack of visa restrictions, many musical groups from Bolivia, Peru and Chile began migrating to Western Europe. Street performing in those early years proved financially viable. The possibility of making a living as a musician in the home country was remote, and many musicians dreamed of success in Western Europe. By the early eighties, the flight of musicians to the west increased. Now many Ecuadorians (particularly from Otavalo) joined the migration. Eventually, there was probably a South American street band in every major European city. I used to joke with some of my band members that they had been seen by people all over the world (“I saw you playing music in Venice last summer…yes, I am sure it was you, you had the same long hair…”).</p><picture>

<p>One anecdote worth recounting, is the chance meeting of Simon and Garfunkle, in the late sixties, in a Paris subway, with the Andean group Los Incas. Here the American duo first heard the timeless Peruvian classic “El Cóndor Pasa”. They pursued by adorning this ancient melody with English lyrics. It would prove to be one of their most popular songs: “I’d rather be a hammer than a nail…”. The “Pan-Andean” movement was well on its way.</p><p>Bolivia continued to be a source of development for the “Pan-Andean” style. Famous groups, like Savia Andina, brought a high degree of professionalism to the new sound. Virtuoso performers executed stylized interpretations of Andean folk music, using the charango, kena, siku and bombo. In Cochabamba, the group Los Kjarkas, blended regional melodies with polished vocals. Their love ballads became the latest manifestation of the new sound that proved incredibly popular with young people. They established schools (Escuela Kjarkas) throughout Bolivia and neighboring Andean countries, to promote their new musical style. My friend, Augurio Quiroz, once said that Los Kjarkas, with their prolific compositions and endearing love songs, were the Beatles of the Andes. I think he was right.</p><picture>
